# Self Evaluation

- Reflect on your time management and awareness of where you spend time. Is this a strength or area you are working on? What support do you need in this area? And/or, what tips do you have to share with your classmates in this area?

It's definitely something I'm working on. I'm doing well so far, but the support I find most useful is consistent accountability checks. I tend to work best with groups that communicate frequently, since, for me, just working with a team that I know is relying on my work serves as an accountability check that keeps me engaged and focused.

- How would you explain to a 5 year old what a function is?

A function is a list of things to do and a password. Whenever you say the password, the computer has to do all the things on the list.

- Share your understanding of arguments and parameters.

An argument is a variable being passed into a function, and a parameter is the variable as it exists within the function. Declaring a variable outside the function and calling the function by passing that variable into the function involve arguments. Once the argument is paired with the parameter in the function's definition it becomes a parameter and operates within the function.

- What questions/topics (related to Functions) do you want to being to your Small Group?

I'm not sure how a function calling another function might work, so that would be fun to discuss.
